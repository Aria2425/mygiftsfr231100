U ain’t just my boyfie you are my bestie n my partner in every sense of the wrld and my heart's true conpanion. I remember when we first met, how I never could have imagined the depth of the connection we’d share or even the fact that I’d acc be able to pull u. From the first spark, I felt like I ws meeting sm1 who understood me in a way no one else ever had. And with every day that passes, my love fr u only deepens. U have a way of makin me feel seen n understood, in a world that often feels shitty n u constantly remind me that love don’t hv  to be complicated to be perfect. 

Ur kindness and strength are unmatched, and the way u care frr others like frnds, ur fam , n me continues to amaze me every single day. I often find myself in awe of ur compassion, ur patience, n ur ability to listen without judgment. U make those around u feel valued, and that’s something so rare in this wrld n u deserve the same. U bring light into every room u enter, n u  make everythin better just by being there. Ur laughter is the sweetest melody to my ears, n ur smile is a constant source of comfort n warmth. When I’m talking to u, only then I feel like I can be my true self unfiltered n free. You bring out the best in me n I hope to do the same, n I’m changing fr the better because of u. I think about all the memories we’ve made tgh from the weird talk n  moments of just being of being unhinged to the deep talks, and I cherish em all. Every moment w u is a memory in the making n I cant wait to see what the future holds for us.

I hope tdy, n every day, u feel as special as u truly are. Ik life isn’t always easy fr u, but with u by my side, I feel like we can take on anth tgh. Wtv challenges come our way, Ik we will face them w the same love n strength that we’ve faced everythin by else. 

On ur birthday, I wanna remind u how proud Im of u. I see ur growth, ur ambition, ur resillence, n  Im in awe of everything you’ve accomplished. U are always striving to be the best version of urself, n that’s smth I truly admire. But even more than ur achievements, it’s your heart that gets me. Ur a leader who stands by right, and tht makes all the difference. Ur ability to be selfless n put others first is smth I will never ever take fr granted, n I promise to always reciprocate tht love, support, n care in every way I truly can. U inspire me to be a better person, and Im forever grateful fr the way u show up in my life.

As u celebrate this special day, I want u to know how deeply I care for u, how deeply I love u. u are my heart, my home, n my will to live. There are so many more birthdays ahead of us, so many more milestones to hit, and so many more memories to create. I cant wait to continue building our life n family tgh, one moment at a time.
